</div><p><span class="dcap">etty</span> looked up from
her magazine. She said
mildly, "You're late."</p>

<p>"Don't yell at me, I
feel awful," Simon told
her. He sat down at his desk, passed
his tongue over his teeth in distaste,
groaned, fumbled in a drawer for the
aspirin bottle.</p>

<p>He looked over at Betty and said,
almost as though reciting, "What I
need is a vacation."</p>

<p>"What," Betty said, "are you going
to use for money?"</p>

<p>"Providence," Simon told her
whilst fiddling with the aspirin bottle,
"will provide."</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m. But before providing
vacations it'd be nice if Providence
turned up a missing jewel deal, say.
Something where you could deduce
that actually the ruby ring had gone
down the drain and was caught in the
elbow. Something that would net
about fifty dollars."</p>

<p>Simon said, mournful of tone,
"Fifty dollars? Why not make it five
hundred?"</p>

<p>"I'm not selfish," Betty said. "All
I want is enough to pay me this
week's salary."</p>

<p>"Money," Simon said. "When you
took this job you said it was the romance
that appealed to you."</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m. I didn't know most
sleuthing amounted to snooping
around department stores to check on
the clerks knocking down."</p>

<p>Simon said, enigmatically, "Now
it comes."</p>

<hr />

<p>There was a knock.</p>

<p>Betty bounced up with Olympic
agility and had the door swinging
wide before the knocking was quite
completed.</p>

<p>He was old, little and had bug
eyes behind pince-nez glasses. His
suit was cut in the style of yesteryear
but when a suit costs two or
three hundred dollars you still retain
caste whatever the styling.</p>

<p>Simon said unenthusiastically,
"Good morning, Mr. Oyster." He indicated
the client's chair. "Sit down,
sir."</p>

<p>The client fussed himself with
Betty's assistance into the seat, bug-eyed
Simon, said finally, "You know
my name, that's pretty good. Never
saw you before in my life. Stop fussing
with me, young lady. Your ad
in the phone book says you'll investigate
anything."</p>

<p>"Anything," Simon said. "Only
one exception."</p>

<p>"Excellent. Do you believe in time
travel?"</p>

<p>Simon said nothing. Across the
room, where she had resumed her
seat, Betty cleared her throat. When
Simon continued to say nothing she
ventured, "Time travel is impossible."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Yes, why?"</p>

<p>Betty looked to her boss for assistance.
None was forthcoming. There
ought to be some very quick, positive,
definite answer. She said, "Well,
for one thing, paradox. Suppose you
had a time machine and traveled back
a hundred years or so and killed your
own great-grandfather. Then how
could you ever be born?"</p>

<p>"Confound it if I know," the little
fellow growled. "How?"</p>

<p>Simon said, "Let's get to the point,
what you wanted to see me about."</p>

<p>"I want to hire you to hunt me up
some time travelers," the old boy
said.</p>

<p>Betty was too far in now to maintain
her proper role of silent secretary.
"Time travelers," she said, not
very intelligently.</p>

<p>The potential client sat more erect,
obviously with intent to hold the
floor for a time. He removed the
pince-nez glasses and pointed them
at Betty. He said, "Have you read
much science fiction, Miss?"</p>

<p>"Some," Betty admitted.</p>

<p>"Then you'll realize that there are
a dozen explanations of the paradoxes
of time travel. Every writer in
the field worth his salt has explained
them away. But to get on. It's my
contention that within a century or
so man will have solved the problems
of immortality and eternal youth, and
it's also my suspicion that he will
eventually be able to travel in time.
So convinced am I of these possibilities
that I am willing to gamble a
portion of my fortune to investigate
the presence in our era of such time
travelers."</p>

<p>Simon seemed incapable of carrying
the ball this morning, so Betty
said, "But ... Mr. Oyster, if the
future has developed time travel why
don't we ever meet such travelers?"</p>

<p>Simon put in a word. "The usual
explanation, Betty, is that they can't
afford to allow the space-time continuum
track to be altered. If, say, a
time traveler returned to a period of
twenty-five years ago and shot Hitler,
then all subsequent history would be
changed. In that case, the time traveler
himself might never be born. They
have to tread mighty carefully."</p>

<p>Mr. Oyster was pleased. "I didn't
expect you to be so well informed
on the subject, young man."</p>

<p>Simon shrugged and fumbled
again with the aspirin bottle.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mr. Oyster went on. "I've been
considering the matter for some time
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Simon held up a hand. "There's
no use prolonging this. As I understand
it, you're an elderly gentleman
with a considerable fortune and you
realize that thus far nobody has succeeded
in taking it with him."</p>

<p>Mr. Oyster returned his glasses to
their perch, bug-eyed Simon, but then
nodded.</p>

<p>Simon said, "You want to hire me
to find a time traveler and in some
manner or other&mdash;any manner will
do&mdash;exhort from him the secret of
eternal life and youth, which you figure
the future will have discovered.
You're willing to pony up a part of
this fortune of yours, if I can deliver
a bona fide time traveler."</p>

<p>"Right!"</p>

<p>Betty had been looking from one
to the other. Now she said, plaintively,
"But where are you going to find
one of these characters&mdash;especially if
they're interested in keeping hid?"</p>

<p>The old boy was the center again.
"I told you I'd been considering it
for some time. The <i>Oktoberfest</i>,
that's where they'd be!" He seemed
elated.</p>

<p>Betty and Simon waited.</p>

<p>"The <i>Oktoberfest</i>," he repeated.
"The greatest festival the world has
ever seen, the carnival, <i>feria</i>, <i>fiesta</i>
to beat them all. Every year it's held
in Munich. Makes the New Orleans
Mardi gras look like a quilting
party." He began to swing into the
spirit of his description. "It originally
started in celebration of the wedding
of some local prince a century
and a half ago and the Bavarians had
such a bang-up time they've been
holding it every year since. The
Munich breweries do up a special
beer, <i>Marzenbr&auml;u</i> they call it, and
each brewery opens a tremendous tent
on the fair grounds which will hold
five thousand customers apiece. Millions
of liters of beer are put away,
hundreds of thousands of barbecued
chickens, a small herd of oxen are
roasted whole over spits, millions of
pair of <i>weisswurst</i>, a very special
sausage, millions upon millions of
pretzels&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right," Simon said. "We'll accept
it. The <i>Oktoberfest</i> is one whale
of a wingding."</p>

<hr />

<p>"Well," the old boy pursued, into
his subject now, "that's where they'd
be, places like the <i>Oktoberfest</i>. For
one thing, a time traveler wouldn't
be conspicuous. At a festival like this
somebody with a strange accent, or
who didn't know exactly how to wear
his clothes correctly, or was off the
ordinary in any of a dozen other
ways, wouldn't be noticed. You could
be a four-armed space traveler from
Mars, and you still wouldn't be conspicuous
at the <i>Oktoberfest</i>. People
would figure they had D.T.'s."</p>

<p>"But why would a time traveler
want to go to a&mdash;" Betty began.</p>

<p>"Why not! What better opportunity
to study a people than when they
are in their cups? If <i>you</i> could go
back a few thousand years, the things
you would wish to see would be a
Roman Triumph, perhaps the Rites
of Dionysus, or one of Alexander's
orgies. You wouldn't want to wander
up and down the streets of, say,
Athens while nothing was going on,
particularly when you might be revealed
as a suspicious character not
being able to speak the language, not
knowing how to wear the clothes and
not familiar with the city's layout."
He took a deep breath. "No ma'am,
you'd have to stick to some great
event, both for the sake of actual
interest and for protection against being
unmasked."</p>

<p>The old boy wound it up. "Well,
that's the story. What are your rates?
The <i>Oktoberfest</i> starts on Friday and
continues for sixteen days. You can
take the plane to Munich, spend a
week there and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Simon was shaking his head. "Not
interested."</p>

<p>As soon as Betty had got her jaw
back into place, she glared unbelievingly
at him.</p>

<p>Mr. Oyster was taken aback himself.
"See here, young man, I realize
this isn't an ordinary assignment,
however, as I said, I am willing to
risk a considerable portion of my
fortune&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sorry," Simon said. "Can't be
done."</p>

<p>"A hundred dollars a day plus expenses,"
Mr. Oyster said quietly. "I
like the fact that you already seem
to have some interest and knowledge
of the matter. I liked the way you
knew my name when I walked in the
door; my picture doesn't appear often
in the papers."</p>

<p>"No go," Simon said, a sad quality
in his voice.</p>

<p>"A fifty thousand dollar bonus if
you bring me a time traveler."</p>

<p>"Out of the question," Simon
said.</p>

<p>"But <i>why</i>?" Betty wailed.</p>

<p>"Just for laughs," Simon told the
two of them sourly, "suppose I tell
you a funny story. It goes like
this:"</p>

<hr class="hrmin" />

<p>I got a thousand dollars from Mr.
Oyster (Simon began) in the way
of an advance, and leaving him with
Betty who was making out a receipt,
I hustled back to the apartment and
packed a bag. Hell, I'd wanted a vacation
anyway, this was a natural. On
the way to Idlewild I stopped off at
the Germany Information Offices for
some tourist literature.</p>

<p>It takes roughly three and a half
hours to get to Gander from Idlewild.
I spent the time planning the
fun I was going to have.</p>

<p>It takes roughly seven and a half
hours from Gander to Shannon and
I spent that time dreaming up material
I could put into my reports to
Mr. Oyster. I was going to have to
give him some kind of report for his
money. Time travel yet! What a
laugh!</p>

<p>Between Shannon and Munich a
faint suspicion began to simmer in
my mind. These statistics I read on
the <i>Oktoberfest</i> in the Munich tourist
pamphlets. Five million people
attended annually.</p>

<p>Where did five million people
come from to attend an overgrown
festival in comparatively remote
Southern Germany? The tourist season
is over before September 21st,
first day of the gigantic beer bust.
Nor could the Germans account for
any such number. Munich itself has
a population of less than a million,
counting children.</p>

<p>And those millions of gallons of
beer, the hundreds of thousands of
chickens, the herds of oxen. Who
ponied up all the money for such expenditures?
How could the average
German, with his twenty-five dollars
a week salary?</p>

<p>In Munich there was no hotel
space available. I went to the Bahnhof
where they have a hotel service
and applied. They put my name
down, pocketed the husky bribe,
showed me where I could check my
bag, told me they'd do what they
could, and to report back in a few
hours.</p>

<p>I had another suspicious twinge.
If five million people attended this
beer bout, how were they accommodated?</p>

<p>The <i>Theresienwiese</i>, the fair
ground, was only a few blocks
away. I was stiff from the plane ride
so I walked.</p>

<hr />

<p>There are seven major brewers in
the Munich area, each of them represented
by one of the circuslike tents
that Mr. Oyster mentioned. Each tent
contained benches and tables for
about five thousand persons and from
six to ten thousands pack themselves
in, competing for room. In the center
is a tremendous bandstand, the
musicians all <i>lederhosen</i> clad, the
music as Bavarian as any to be found
in a Bavarian beer hall. Hundreds of
peasant garbed <i>fr&auml;uleins</i> darted about
the tables with quart sized earthenware
mugs, platters of chicken, sausage,
kraut and pretzels.</p>

<p>I found a place finally at a table
which had space for twenty-odd beer
bibbers. Odd is right. As weird an
assortment of Germans and foreign
tourists as could have been dreamed
up, ranging from a seventy- or
eighty-year-old couple in Bavarian
costume, to the bald-headed drunk
across the table from me.</p>

<p>A desperate waitress bearing six
mugs of beer in each hand scurried
past. They call them <i>masses</i>, by the
way, not mugs. The bald-headed
character and I both held up a finger
and she slid two of the <i>masses</i> over
to us and then hustled on.</p>

<p>"Down the hatch," the other said,
holding up his <i>mass</i> in toast.</p>

<p>"To the ladies," I told him. Before
sipping, I said, "You know, the
tourist pamphlets say this stuff is
eighteen per cent. That's nonsense.
No beer is that strong." I took a long
pull.</p>

<p>He looked at me, waiting.</p>

<p>I came up. "Mistaken," I admitted.</p>

<p>A <i>mass</i> or two apiece later he looked
carefully at the name engraved on
his earthenware mug. "L&ouml;wenbr&auml;u,"
he said. He took a small notebook
from his pocket and a pencil, noted
down the word and returned the
things.</p>

<p>"That's a queer looking pencil you
have there," I told him. "German?"</p>

<p>"Venusian," he said. "Oops, sorry.
Shouldn't have said that."</p>

<p>I had never heard of the brand so
I skipped it.</p>

<p>"Next is the Hofbr&auml;u," he said.</p>

<p>"Next what?" Baldy's conversation
didn't seem to hang together very
well.</p>

<p>"My pilgrimage," he told me. "All
my life I've been wanting to go back
to an <i>Oktoberfest</i> and sample every
one of the seven brands of the best
beer the world has ever known. I'm
only as far as L&ouml;wenbr&auml;u. I'm afraid
I'll never make it."</p>

<p>I finished my <i>mass</i>. "I'll help
you," I told him. "Very noble endeavor.
Name is Simon."</p>

<p>"Arth," he said. "How could you
help?"</p>

<p>"I'm still fresh&mdash;comparatively.
I'll navigate you around. There are
seven beer tents. How many have you
got through, so far?"</p>

<p>"Two, counting this one," Arth
said.</p>

<p>I looked at him. "It's going to be
a chore," I said. "You've already got
a nice edge on."</p>

<p>Outside, as we made our way to
the next tent, the fair looked like
every big State-Fair ever seen, except
it was bigger. Games, souvenir
stands, sausage stands, rides, side
shows, and people, people, people.</p>

<p>The Hofbr&auml;u tent was as overflowing
as the last but we managed to
find two seats.</p>

<p>The band was blaring, and five
thousand half-swacked voices were
roaring accompaniment.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>In Muenchen steht ein Hofbr&auml;uhaus!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Eins, Zwei, G'sufa!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the <i>G'sufa</i> everybody upped
with the mugs and drank each other's
health.</p>

<p>"This is what I call a real beer
bust," I said approvingly.</p>

<p>Arth was waving to a waitress. As
in the L&ouml;wenbr&auml;u tent, a full quart
was the smallest amount obtainable.</p>

<p>A beer later I said, "I don't know
if you'll make it or not, Arth."</p>

<p>"Make what?"</p>

<p>"All seven tents."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>A waitress was on her way by,
mugs foaming over their rims. I gestured
to her for refills.</p>

<p>"Where are you from, Arth?" I
asked him, in the way of making
conversation.</p>

<p>"2183."</p>

<p>"2183 where?"</p>

<p>He looked at me, closing one eye
to focus better. "Oh," he said. "Well,
2183 South Street, ah, New Albuquerque."</p>

<p>"New Albuquerque? Where's
that?"</p>

<p>Arth thought about it. Took another
long pull at the beer. "Right
across the way from old Albuquerque,"
he said finally. "Maybe we
ought to be getting on to the
Pschorrbr&auml;u tent."</p>

<p>"Maybe we ought to eat something
first," I said. "I'm beginning to feel
this. We could get some of that barbecued
ox."</p>

<p>Arth closed his eyes in pain.
"Vegetarian," he said. "Couldn't possibly
eat meat. Barbarous. Ugh."</p>

<p>"Well, we need some nourishment,"
I said.</p>

<p>"There's supposed to be considerable
nourishment in beer."</p>

<p>That made sense. I yelled, "<i>Fr&auml;ulein!
Zwei neu bier!</i>"</p>

<hr />

<p>Somewhere along in here the fog
rolled in. When it rolled out again,
I found myself closing one eye the
better to read the lettering on my
earthenware mug. It read Augustinerbr&auml;u.
Somehow we'd evidently
navigated from one tent to another.</p>

<p>Arth was saying, "Where's your
hotel?"</p>

<p>That seemed like a good question.
I thought about it for a while. Finally
I said, "Haven't got one. Town's
jam packed. Left my bag at the Bahnhof.
I don't think we'll ever make
it, Arth. How many we got to
go?"</p>

<p>"Lost track," Arth said. "You can
come home with me."</p>

<p>We drank to that and the fog rolled
in again.</p>

<p>When the fog rolled out, it was
daylight. Bright, glaring, awful daylight.
I was sprawled, complete with
clothes, on one of twin beds. On the
other bed, also completely clothed,
was Arth.</p>

<p>That sun was too much. I stumbled
up from the bed, staggered to
the window and fumbled around for
a blind or curtain. There was none.</p>

<p>Behind me a voice said in horror,
"Who ... how ... oh, <i>Wodo</i>,
where'd you come from?"</p>

<p>I got a quick impression, looking
out the window, that the Germans
were certainly the most modern, futuristic
people in the world. But I
couldn't stand the light. "Where's
the shade," I moaned.</p>

<p>Arth did something and the window
went opaque.</p>

<p>"That's quite a gadget," I groaned.
"If I didn't feel so lousy, I'd
appreciate it."</p>

<p>Arth was sitting on the edge of
the bed holding his bald head in his
hands. "I remember now," he sorrowed.
"You didn't have a hotel.
What a stupidity. I'll be phased.
Phased all the way down."</p>

<p>"You haven't got a handful of
aspirin, have you?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Just a minute," Arth said, staggering
erect and heading for what
undoubtedly was a bathroom. "Stay
where you are. Don't move. Don't
touch anything."</p>

<p>"All right," I told him plaintively.
"I'm clean. I won't mess up the
place. All I've got is a hangover, not
lice."</p>

<p>Arth was gone. He came back in
two or three minutes, box of pills in
hand. "Here, take one of these."</p>

<p>I took the pill, followed it with a
glass of water.</p>

<hr />

<p>And went out like a light.</p>

<p>Arth was shaking my arm. "Want
another <i>mass</i>?"</p>

<p>The band was blaring, and five
thousand half-swacked voices were
roaring accompaniment.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>In Muenchen steht ein Hofbr&auml;uhaus!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Eins, Zwei, G'sufa!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the <i>G'sufa</i> everybody upped
with their king-size mugs and drank
each other's health.</p>

<p>My head was killing me. "This is
where I came in, or something," I
groaned.</p>

<p>Arth said, "That was last night."
He looked at me over the rim of his
beer mug.</p>

<p>Something, somewhere, was
wrong. But I didn't care. I finished
my <i>mass</i> and then remembered. "I've
got to get my bag. Oh, my head.
Where did we spend last night?"</p>

<p>Arth said, and his voice sounded
cautious, "At my hotel, don't you remember?"</p>

<p>"Not very well," I admitted. "I
feel lousy. I must have dimmed out.
I've got to go to the Bahnhof and
get my luggage."</p>

<p>Arth didn't put up an argument
on that. We said good-by and I could
feel him watching after me as I pushed
through the tables on the way
out.</p>

<p>At the Bahnhof they could do me
no good. There were no hotel rooms
available in Munich. The head was
getting worse by the minute. The
fact that they'd somehow managed
to lose my bag didn't help. I worked
on that project for at least a couple
of hours. Not only wasn't the bag
at the luggage checking station, but
the attendant there evidently couldn't
make heads nor tails of the check
receipt. He didn't speak English and
my high school German was inadequate,
especially accompanied by a
blockbusting hangover.</p>

<p>I didn't get anywhere tearing my
hair and complaining from one end
of the Bahnhof to the other. I drew
a blank on the bag.</p>

<p>And the head was getting worse
by the minute. I was bleeding to
death through the eyes and instead
of butterflies I had bats in my stomach.
Believe me, <i>nobody</i> should drink
a gallon or more of Marzenbr&auml;u.</p>

<hr />

<p>I decided the hell with it. I took
a cab to the airport, presented my return
ticket, told them I wanted to
leave on the first obtainable plane to
New York. I'd spent two days at the
<i>Oktoberfest</i>, and I'd had it.</p>

<p>I got more guff there. Something
was wrong with the ticket, wrong
date or some such. But they fixed
that up. I never was clear on what
was fouled up, some clerk's error,
evidently.</p>

<p>The trip back was as uninteresting
as the one over. As the hangover began
to wear off&mdash;a little&mdash;I was almost
sorry I hadn't been able to stay.
If I'd only been able to get a room I
<i>would</i> have stayed, I told myself.</p>

<p>From Idlewild, I came directly to
the office rather than going to my
apartment. I figured I might as well
check in with Betty.</p>

<p>I opened the door and there I
found Mr. Oyster sitting in the chair
he had been occupying four&mdash;or was
it five&mdash;days before when I'd left.
I'd lost track of the time.</p>

<p>I said to him, "Glad you're here,
sir. I can report. Ah, what was it
you came for? Impatient to hear if
I'd had any results?" My mind was
spinning like a whirling dervish in
a revolving door. I'd spent a wad of
his money and had nothing I could
think of to show for it; nothing but
the last stages of a grand-daddy
hangover.</p>

<p>"Came for?" Mr. Oyster snorted.
"I'm merely waiting for your girl to
make out my receipt. I thought you
had already left."</p>

<p>"You'll miss your plane," Betty
said.</p>

<p>There was suddenly a double dip
of ice cream in my stomach. I walked
over to my desk and looked down at
the calendar.</p>

<p>Mr. Oyster was saying something
to the effect that if I didn't leave today,
it would have to be tomorrow,
that he hadn't ponied up that thousand
dollars advance for anything
less than immediate service. Stuffing
his receipt in his wallet, he fussed
his way out the door.</p>

<p>I said to Betty hopefully, "I suppose
you haven't changed this calendar
since I left."</p>

<p>Betty said, "What's the matter
with you? You look funny. How did
your clothes get so mussed? You tore
the top sheet off that calendar yourself,
not half an hour ago, just before
this marble-missing client came
in." She added, irrelevantly, "Time
travelers yet."</p>

<p>I tried just once more. "Uh, when
did you first see this Mr. Oyster?"</p>

<p>"Never saw him before in my
life," she said. "Not until he came
in this morning."</p>

<p>"This morning," I said weakly.</p>

<p>While Betty stared at me as though
it was <i>me</i> that needed candling by a
head shrinker preparatory to being
sent off to a pressure cooker, I fished
in my pocket for my wallet, counted
the contents and winced at the
pathetic remains of the thousand.
I said pleadingly, "Betty, listen,
how long ago did I go out that door&mdash;on
the way to the airport?"</p>

<p>"You've been acting sick all morning.
You went out that door about
ten minutes ago, were gone about
three minutes, and then came back."</p>

<hr class="hrmin" />

<p>"See here," Mr. Oyster said (interrupting
Simon's story), "did you
say this was supposed to be amusing,
young man? I don't find it so. In
fact, I believe I am being ridiculed."</p>

<p>Simon shrugged, put one hand to
his forehead and said, "That's only
the first chapter. There are two
more."</p>

<p>"I'm not interested in more," Mr.
Oyster said. "I suppose your point
was to show me how ridiculous the
whole idea actually is. Very well,
you've done it. Confound it. However,
I suppose your time, even when
spent in this manner, has some value.
Here is fifty dollars. And good day,
sir!"</p>

<p>He slammed the door after him
as he left.</p>

<p>Simon winced at the noise, took
the aspirin bottle from its drawer,
took two, washed them down with
water from the desk carafe.</p>

<p>Betty looked at him admiringly.
Came to her feet, crossed over and
took up the fifty dollars. "Week's
wages," she said. "I suppose that's
one way of taking care of a crackpot.
But I'm surprised you didn't
take his money and enjoy that vacation
you've been yearning about."</p>

<p>"I did," Simon groaned. "Three
times."</p>

<p>Betty stared at him. "You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>Simon nodded, miserably.</p>

<p>She said, "But <i>Simon</i>. Fifty thousand
dollars bonus. If that story was
true, you should have gone back
again to Munich. If there was one
time traveler, there might have
been&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I keep telling you," Simon said
bitterly, "I went back there three
times. There were hundreds of them.
Probably thousands." He took a deep
breath. "Listen, we're just going to
have to forget about it. They're not
going to stand for the space-time
continuum track being altered. If
something comes up that looks like
it might result in the track being
changed, they set you right back at
the beginning and let things start&mdash;for
you&mdash;all over again. They just
can't allow anything to come back
from the future and change the
past."</p>

<p>"You mean," Betty was suddenly
furious at him, "you've given up!
Why this is the biggest thing&mdash; Why
the fifty thousand dollars is nothing.
The future! Just think!"</p>

<p>Simon said wearily, "There's just
one thing you can bring back with
you from the future, a hangover compounded
of a gallon or so of Marzenbr&auml;u.
What's more you can pile
one on top of the other, and another
on top of that!"</p>

<p>He shuddered. "If you think I'm
going to take another crack at this
merry-go-round and pile a fourth
hangover on the three I'm already
nursing, all at once, you can think
again."</p>
